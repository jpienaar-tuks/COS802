# COS802
Project intent is to examine the impact of emoji's on a 
sentiment analysis task for a low resource language (Hausa).

Project will be using the Afrisenti-Semeval dataset as well as
several multilingual transformer models:
* castorini/afriberta_small
* castorini/afriberta_base
* xlm-roberta-base 

I had originally also wanted to include *google/rembert* but kept encountering
memory limitations on my hardware
