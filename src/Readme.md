# COS802
Initially I wanted to use TensorFlow models since I already had it set up
on my GPU due an earlier COS801 project. However, I continuously ran into
out-of-memory issues and all of the huggingface documentation assumes
PyTorch, so I had to switch and take the time to get it set up. 

'emoji ords.json' contains a list of the ordinal values of all the emoji's
in the data file that was used at least 200 times.
